**Hedgehog** is alternative to Metamask that manages a user's private key and wallet on the browser. It exposes a simple API to allow you to create an authentication scheme to let users sign up and login to their wallet across multiple browsers and devices. [hedgehog.audius.co](https://audius.co/hedgehog).

With Hedgehog:

* üòç Users can make accounts in your DApp with a username + password.
* üò± Users don't have to worry about private keys, no mnemonics.
* üîè You can build systems that fund users' wallets, sign transactions, but never control those wallets directly.
* üåá You can focus on building your business logic, rather than managing wallets.

## Why Use This?

### Not All Transactions Are Created Equal
Currently available wallets treat every transaction as if it were moving around your life‚Äôs savings. Hedgehog was built for use-cases involving low-to-no financial value.

**NOTE**: The primary improvement to end-user experience is by hiding wallet complexity and not forcing users to constantly confirm transactions - The opposite of what you‚Äôd want when moving significant money around.

### Is Hedgehog Right for your DApp?
Hedgehog isn‚Äôt right for every DApp. Massive improvements in user experience are only possible through tradeoffs. As a general rule Hedgehog should not be used for apps involving significant sums of money. As a bridge, one could start users on Hedgehog and suggest migrating to a more secure wallet if their stored value increases beyond a certain threshold; the Hedgehog paradigm is interoperable with existing web3 providers too.

[Good use cases]
* Signing data
* Gaming DApp
* Decentralized Music Player

[Bad use cases]
* Banking DApp
* Decentralized Lending
* Prediction Markets


## A Closer Look 

Hedgehog is a package that lives in your front end application to create and manage a user's entropy (from which a private key is derived). Hedgehog relies on a username and password to create auth artifacts, so it's able to simulate a familiar authentication system that allows users to sign up or login from multiple browsers or devices and retrieve their entropy. Those artifacts, through hedgehog, are persisted to a backend of your choosing.

**NOTE**: A private key is only computed and available client side and is never transmitted or stored anywhere besides the user's browser.

```javascript
// Provide getFn, setAuthFn, setUserFn as requests to your database/backend service (more details in docs).
const hedgehog = new Hedgehog(getFn, setAuthFn, setUserFn)
let wallet
if (hedgehog.isLoggedIn()) {
  wallet = hedgehog.getWallet()
} else {
  wallet = await hedgehog.login('username', 'password')
  // or
  wallet = await hedgehog.signUp('username', 'password')
}

```

After creating or retrieving a user's wallet, you can either **fund their wallet directly** to pay transaction fees or **relay their transactions through a EIP-712 relayer**.
